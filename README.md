Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)
Project Description
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets using Machine Learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression. The sentiment analysis categorizes tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This can be useful for understanding public opinion, monitoring social media, and improving customer service.

Features
Data Collection: Fetch tweets using the Twitter API.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the tweets for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Use techniques like TF-IDF to extract features from the text.
Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model to classify tweet sentiments.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Visualize the results using various plots.
Installation Instructions
Prerequisites
Python (version 3.7 or higher)
Twitter Developer Account (for API keys)
Steps
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
Create a virtual environment

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Twitter API keys

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your Twitter API keys:
makefile
Copy code
CONSUMER_KEY=your-consumer-key
CONSUMER_SECRET=your-consumer-secret
ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-access-token-secret
Run the script to collect and analyze tweets

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage Instructions
Collect Tweets
Modify the main.py script to specify the search term and the number of tweets to fetch.

Run Sentiment Analysis
The main.py script will preprocess the tweets, extract features, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Example Usage
Fetching Tweets: Specify the search term in main.py.
Analyzing Sentiment: The results will be displayed in the console and visualizations will be saved to the output directory.
